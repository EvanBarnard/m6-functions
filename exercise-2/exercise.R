# Exercise 2: writing and executing functions (II)

# Write a function `CompareLength` that takes in 2 vectors, and returns the sentence:
# "The difference in lengths is N"

CompareLength <- function(a,b){
  
  
  vector1 <- length(a)
  vector2 <- length(b)
  difference <- abs(vector1 - vector2)
  
  answer <- "The difference in lengths is " + difference
  
  return(answer)
  
}

# Pass two vectors of different length to your `CompareLength` function


# Write a function `DescribeDifference` that will return one of the following statements:
# "Your first vector is longer by N elements"
# "Your second vector is longer by N elements"


# Pass two vectors to your `DescribeDifference` function


### Bonus ###

# Rewrite your `DescribeDifference` function to tell you the name of the vector which is longer
